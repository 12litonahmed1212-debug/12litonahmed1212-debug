# Hello there! I'm Liton 👋

### 💻 Aspiring Web Developer

I'm currently on a journey to build a strong foundation in frontend web development. I love the process of turning ideas into functional, interactive websites!

### 🌱 I'm Currently Learning & Building With:

* **HTML:** Mastering semantic structure and accessibility.
* **CSS:** Diving deep into Flexbox, Grid, and responsive design for beautiful layouts.
* **JavaScript (JS):** Learning how to manipulate the DOM and add dynamic behavior to web pages.

I'm focused on creating small projects and challenges to solidify these fundamentals.
